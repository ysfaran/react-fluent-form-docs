import Highlight from "../../src/mdx-components/Highlight";

Sometimes it's better to seperate your forms, for example if:

- they deal with different concerns
- it should be possible to save them independently
- they are placed inside a wizard

In some cases you might have to connect them back together in order to submit all forms at once.
As an example you could have multiple forms which can be saved independently and then also a <Highlight>Save All</Highlight> button, to trigger submission for all forms.

## useMergedSubmit

`useMergedSubmit` is a custom hook, that returns a function which is similar to the [`handleSubmit`](../api/use-fluent-form#handlesubmit) returned by `useFluentForm`.
It receives any amount of fluent form instances as paramater:

```ts
import { useCallback, useRef } from "react";
import { UseFluentForm } from "react-fluent-form";

export function useMergedSubmit(...fluentForms: UseFluentForm<any>[]) {
  const successCallbackRef = useRef<Function>(() => undefined);
  const failureCallbackRef = useRef<Function>(() => undefined);

  const handleSubmit = useCallback(
    (
      success: Function = () => undefined,
      failure: Function = () => undefined
    ) => {
      successCallbackRef.current = success;
      failureCallbackRef.current = failure;

      return async (e: any) => {
        if (typeof e === "object") {
          if (typeof e.preventDefault === "function") {
            e.preventDefault();
          }
          if (typeof e.stopPropagation === "function") {
            e.stopPropagation();
          }
        }

        const submitPromises: Promise<boolean>[] = [];

        for (let i = 0; i < fluentForms.length; i++) {
          const currentForm = fluentForms[i];
          const currentPromise = new Promise<boolean>((resolve) => {
            currentForm.handleSubmit(
              () => resolve(true),
              () => resolve(false)
            )(e);
          });
          submitPromises.push(currentPromise);
        }

        const results: boolean[] = await Promise.all(submitPromises).catch(() =>
          failure()
        );

        const successful = results.every((results) => results);

        successful
          ? successCallbackRef.current()
          : failureCallbackRef.current();
      };
    },
    [fluentForms]
  );
  return handleSubmit;
}
```

## Example

Following example contains two seperate forms: one for personal details and another for address details.
The `handleSubmit` function returned by `useMergedSubmit` can be called with with a success/failure callback and triggered via e.g. a button click:

```jsx
const personalForm = useFluentForm(personalConfig);
const addressForm = useFluentForm(addressConfig);

const handleSubmit = useMergedSubmit(
  personalForm,
  addressForm
  /* add any amount of forms */
);

// will be called if there is no error in every form
const handleSubmitSuccess = () => {
  console.log(personalForm.values);
  console.log(addressForm.values);
};

// will be called if there is at least one error in any form
const handleSubmitFailure = () => {
  console.log(personalForm.errors);
  console.log(addressForm.errors);
};

return (
  // render forms ...
  <button onClick={handleSubmit(handleSubmitSuccess, handleSubmitFailure)} />
);
```
